# Webpage Summarizer with OpenAI and Python

## Overview
This project is a Python-based application that fetches webpage content and subpage links, extracts their text, and generates summaries using OpenAI's API. It saves the summaries in a Markdown file, making it easier to process and analyze webpage content in a concise format.

The application leverages the `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, and OpenAI libraries, along with environment variable management through `dotenv`.

## Requirements

To run this project, you'll need the following dependencies:

- `requests`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `openai`
- `python-dotenv`

You can install these dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup and Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Environment Setup**  
   Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Input URLs**  
   Add URLs to a `urls.json` file in the following format:
   ```json
   {
       "urls": [
           "https://example.com",
           "https://another-example.com"
       ]
   }
   ```

4. **Run the Application**  
   Execute the script to fetch, summarize, and save content:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

5. **Output**  
   The summaries will be saved to a Markdown file named `summaries_<date>.md`.

## Features

- **Webpage Content Extraction**  
  Fetches the main content from a webpage, including paragraphs (`<p>` tags).
  
- **Subpage Link Crawling**  
  Identifies and processes subpage links within the main page.

- **Text Summarization**  
  Uses OpenAI's API to generate concise summaries of the content.

- **Markdown Export**  
  Saves all summaries in a well-structured Markdown file for easy review.

## How It Works

1. **Environment Variable Management**  
   The `.env` file is used to securely store and retrieve the OpenAI API key.

2. **Webpage and Subpage Processing**  
   The application fetches both the main page and its subpages, extracting their textual content.

3. **OpenAI Summarization**  
   The combined text is sent to OpenAI's API, which returns a summary.

4. **Output**  
   Summaries are written to a Markdown file, categorized by URL.

## Example

Here's an example output saved in the Markdown file:

```markdown
# Summaries

## https://example.com

This webpage discusses the benefits of using Python for web development, including its simplicity and robust libraries.

## https://example.com/about

The 'About' page explains the company's history, mission, and core values.
```

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for fetching metadata like titles and descriptions.
- Improve subpage filtering to avoid irrelevant links.
- Introduce error handling for complex webpage structures.
